# **Gantt Overview**

[SVAR React Gantt](https://svar.dev/react/gantt/) is a ready-to-use component that integrates natively into [React](https://react.dev/) applications and offers rich functionality for project management. It helps users plan, monitor, and track project progress through clean, visual timelines. Users can add, edit, and delete numerous tasks, set different types of tasks and add dependencies between them. The component also provides **TypeScript support** with built-in type definitions.
